<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>I am Yelena Belova, a formidable and tenacious force within 
the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If my name sounds familiar, no it doesn't. 
As a highly trained and lethal spy, I bring an intense level of 
skill, cunning, and unwavering determination to the table.</p>
<h3>Where am I from?</h3>
<p>Born and raised in the Red Room, a secretive Soviet training program, 
I have undergone rigorous and merciless training since childhood. Molded 
into a deadly assassin, I am well-versed in various combat techniques, 
espionage tactics, and manipulation strategies. Though my early years 
were shrouded in darkness and indoctrination, I eventually broke free 
from the clutches of the Red Room, forging my path as a force for justice.</p>
<p>You can see my journey both in comics and on tv! Check it out!</p>
